# Element machine

a small app to test myself.
why not make this experience useful with something that can speed my workflow.
noemorphism style - i want to make a kind of organic feel to the interaction with the app. 
intuitive interaction - i want to make the users next move as obvious as possible, using the conventions from the most used OS's and creative softwares. 

# the project will include:
basic use of the 3 pillers of web dev: html, css, and JS.
1. html - practice the BEM naming convention.
2. css - exercise writing my code with scss. upping my game :)
3. js - i will try to emplement the MVC structure as best as i grasp it.
4. canvas api - to make it that much easier for me.

# my plans for concepts and Features:
1. click and drag actions to create elements
2. a unique menue will apear on element creation, containing drag\scroll\dile\checkbox parameters
3. ability to control styles through interaction and parameters for presission
4. bounding box to control transformation, rotation scale.
5. snap and aigning tools for pixel perfect design. (somtimes you want things to be just tini wini perfect).
6. an output that will update to give the html\css\js for the elementS
